## Welcome to GitHub Pages

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/SongHaixu/shx.github.io/edit/gh-pages/index.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### Markdown

Markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling your writing. It includes conventions for

```markdown
Syntax highlighted code block

# Header 1
## Header 2
### Header 3

- Bulleted
- List

1. Numbered
2. List

**Bold** and _Italic_ and `Code` text

[Link](url) and ![Image](src)
```

For more details see [Basic writing and formatting syntax](https://docs.github.com/en/github/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax).

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/SongHaixu/shx.github.io/settings/pages). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.

### RESEARCH EXPERIENCE

**HIT Smart Car & Innovation Club**

Team Member under the guidance of Prof. Ju Huo

* Image Processing: Developed code for detecting racetrack and specific elements like roundabout, Calculated the path and direction which the smart car needed to follow
* Robot controlling: Maintained the balance and high speed of robot, Controlled the direction in real time based on PID method

**Key Laboratory of Autonomous Intelligent Unmanned Systems**

Research Assistant under the guidance of Prof. Guanghui Sun, Prof. Jianxing Liu and Prof. Weiran Yao

_Participated in an engineering project - Design and Verification Platform of Unmanned System_

* Built a data transmission system among multiple computers based on Modbus communication protocol, Established a virtual environment based on Unity3d which could verify the control algorithm and display real-time information of realistic environment
* Detected and located robots from various camps, Generated motion strategy based on reinforcement learning

_Researched on Deep Learning_

* Transfer learning: Proposed a new method to solve the transfer task when target domain doesn't involve enough data
* AI safety: Used CNN-RNN architecture to classify multi-label picture, Applied common methods like FGSM to attack the network, Proposed a new method of generating adversarial examples
